This section is intended to give a brief overview on the basic Markdown syntax elements. The only difference to common Markdown at this point is, that you can define meta-information such as author, language, voice, etc. within a HTML-comment at the beginning of every document. We will describe all of these elements in more detail in section: Macros. All of these macros start with a single word, which is followed by a colon. If you require more space, like for comment: or link: you can use multiple lines, but every following line has to start with an indentation.
